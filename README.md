# Intrinsic SDK

The Intrinsic SDK is a collection of application programming interfaces
(APIs) and tools for software developers to write code that works with
[Flowstate](https://intrinsic.ai/flowstate), a web-based tool to build
robotic solutions from concept to deployment.

In addition to this
[SDK repository](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/intrinsic_sdks), there is a
companion repository with
[examples](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk-examples) and a dev container
[project template](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/project-template).

subject to change.
Use of this repository requires participation in the beta for Intrinsic
Flowstate, which is accepting [applications](https://intrinsic.ai/beta).
